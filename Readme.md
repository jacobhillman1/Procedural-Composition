Procedural Composition
======================

This is a basic implementation of procedural musical compostion in Java using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE. 

The program is, indirectly, an unweighted first-order markov chain built from the [Harmonic Progression Diagram for Major Keys](http://learnmusictheory.net/diatonic/index.asp?FileName=02-03-HarmonicProgressionDiagrams). 

The program determines "legal" chord progressions and plays the root of each chord sequentially.
